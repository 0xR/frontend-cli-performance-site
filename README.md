# Frontend CLI performance

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/0xR/frontend-cli-performance-site.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

We are measuring the performance (time until first render) for apps created with several CLIs:

* Angular CLI
* `create-react-app`
* `create-nuxt-app` - SPA (static) and Universal rendering
* Vue CLI 3 - `Default`, `Simple with Prettier`, and `nuxt-community/starter-template` templates
* Polymer CLI

## Install

Run `yarn` from the root. If you run into problems, run `install.sh`.

## Run locally

Run `npm run dev` from one of the packages to run a website.

## Production (WIP)

Run `npm start` from one of the packages. This runs in production mode. We expect the bundle already be built.
